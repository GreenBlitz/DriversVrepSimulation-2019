# DriversVrepSimulation-2019

GreenBlitz Driver Simulation is a robot simulation which purpose is to train drivers, and to simulate games and strategies.

## Features

The simulation supports the entire 2019 game, with an option to driver couple of robots at the same time.
The simulation is built with the V-Rep simulator, V-Rep is a great tool to build any simulation of any kind, for more information about V-Rep see: http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/.

## Installation

In order to use GreenBlitz Driver Simulation, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download educational version of V-Rep to your computer from this site: http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html.
2. Active the V-Rep installation file and finish the installation.
3. Download the latest GreenBlitz Driver Simulation version from this Git repository.

In order to activate and use the simulation you first need to connect a joystick to your computer.
After you may start the simulation by opening the latest simulation file.
*if you change the connected joystick when the simulation is activated you need to reset the simulation.

## Basic V-Rep 

V-Rep is a robot simulation, when you are using the simulation, you are using it in the creation area, which means that you can change the simulation to your liking.

### Movement

To move in the simulation, you need to press the movement button in left side of the toolbar and move by clicking on the left click and moving the mouse.
To change your perspective, press the angle button in left side of the toolbar, press on the left button and to move the mouse.

### Activation

To activate the simulation press on the activation button, in the middle of the toolbar, (triangle shape), and to close the simulation run press on the stop buttons, in middle of the toolbar.

*For more information about V-Rep see V-Rep BubbleRob tuturial : http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/bubbleRobTutorial.htm.

## Joystick Buttons

The robots in the simulation are controlled by a joystick like an Xbox controller.
- Left axis - forward and backward -move value
- Right axis - side axis - rotate value
- Povs - up and down - control the elevator
- Y - change gear from power to speed and backward.
- A - open a window with a view from the robot driver station, and after it every press change the view to another driver station or to the robot camera.
- B - if the robot is near his team feeder, than the feeder throw one disk
- X - same as b but with balls.
- LB - pick up a ball or a disk in range of 60 cm from the elevator, works only when the elevator is in the lowest level.
- LR - throw the grabbed object, if is in a range of 60 cm from a tower or bay and have a disk then place the disk in the bay or in the tower, dependent on your elevator level.
